📝 Test 1: Spell "SOS" (Easiest - You already did this!)
Your debug showed 'S' = 100% confidence, so this should be perfect!
Steps:
bashpython ui/app_hybrid_simple.py
When the camera window opens:

Sign 'S'

Make the 'S' hand sign
Hold steady for 3 seconds (count: 1-Mississippi, 2-Mississippi, 3-Mississippi)
Watch bottom of screen → should show "Text: S"


Return to neutral

Open hand (NOTHING gesture)
Hold for 1-2 seconds


Sign 'O'

Make the 'O' hand sign
Hold steady for 3 seconds
Should show "Text: SO"


Return to neutral

Open hand again


Sign 'S' again

Hold steady for 3 seconds
Should show "Text: SOS"


Press 'S' key on keyboard

Should hear: "S O S"


Press 'Q' to quit


📝 Test 2: Spell "HELLO"
This is harder because you need to know all 5 letters!
ASL Alphabet Quick Reference:
H = Extended index and middle finger together, horizontal
E = Closed fist with thumb across fingers
L = Extended index finger and thumb (L-shape)
O = All fingertips touching in circle
Steps:

Run the app
Sign: H → neutral → E → neutral → L → neutral → L → neutral → O
Hold each letter for 3 seconds
Return to neutral between letters
Watch buffer accumulate: "H" → "HE" → "HEL" → "HELL" → "HELLO"
Press 'S' to speak "HELLO"


📝 Test 3: Use SPACE Between Words
Let's spell "HI MOM":

Sign: H → I
Sign SPACE gesture (check your ASL chart for SPACE sign)
Sign: M → O → M
Should show: "HI MOM"
Press 'S' to speak


🎯 Tips for Success:
If letters not appearing:

✅ Hold longer (4-5 seconds)
✅ Make sign more distinct
✅ Better lighting
✅ Position hand center of frame
✅ Plain background behind hand

If wrong letters detected:

✅ Press 'B' to backspace
✅ Or press 'C' to clear all
✅ Try again with clearer sign

If accumulating too fast:

✅ Make sure to return to NOTHING (open palm) between letters
✅ This prevents repeated letters


🎬 Quick Demo Script for Presentation:
Show this to your professor:

Start the app → Show camera window
Spell "SOS" → Show real-time accumulation
Press 'S' → Demonstrate TTS
Clear buffer (press 'C')
Spell your name → Shows it works for any word
Switch to Streamlit → Upload word video → Show word recognition
Explain: "This combines letter-by-letter (unlimited vocabulary) with word recognition (faster for known signs)"


📊 Your System Capabilities:
✅ Letters: Can spell ANY word (A-Z alphabet)
✅ Words: Fast recognition of 8 trained words: yes, no, please, stop, bad, sorry, help, hello
✅ Hybrid: Combine both approaches in one text buffer
✅ TTS: Speaks everything you spell

Want to try right now? Run the app and:

Spell "SOS" (you know S and O work perfectly!)
Tell me what appears in the buffer!

Or if you need ASL hand sign images for H-E-L-L-O, I can describe each one! 🚀
Which word do you want to practice first? "SOS", "HELLO", or your name?
